' How to change background color for modified cells
' 
' This example shows how to highlight grid cells that have been edited by a user.
' When a user changes a value and leaves the modified cell, the cell turns
' red.
' Update:
' This approach may look cumbersome if you have a lot of columns.
' We've prepared another example demonstrating how to accomplish a similar task
' with a dictionary of cell states: http://www.devexpress.com/scid=E4025.
